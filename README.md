# CS211_Final
TSP

This C++ project is in response to a prompt based on the Travelling Salesman Problem. It asks the user to visit 1000 locations around the world, given as longitude and latitude coordinates, in the shortest time possible.  I decided to aproach this problem by grouping the coordinates into 'regions' which represented large airspaces of which all the regions have to be visited before the next one can be travelled to.
